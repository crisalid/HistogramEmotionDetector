# HistogramEmotionDetector
Experimental emotion detector with no deep learning used for classification.
System requirements:
OpenCV 4, Dlib, additional libraries listed in the header.
to run the code just type in python3 custom_histogram5.py

I know it's not exactly a linux admin script for aws, however that's what I can share without breaking NDA's.

Don't worry - I know how to use boto3, psutil, subprocess :)

Thanks for your time!
